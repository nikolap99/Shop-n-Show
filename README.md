# Shop-N-Show

## An Angular application developed to showcase basic Angular concepts such as components, services, modules etc.

## Development

Run `npm ci` to install node_modules needed for the app to run.

Run `ng serve --open` to start a server. This will automatically open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
